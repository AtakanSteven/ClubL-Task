# Important Notes!
- Since there were nested requests, github api responded with 'API rate limit exceeded for {{my IP}}', so I could not retrieve data to check my results.
- "CSV file with a row per each commit. Three columns:
  The first containing the repo URL
  The second containing the last comment URL
  The third containing the 2nd to last comment URL"
  
  Since there were no comments in any of the commits, I could not show any data in the csv file as intended. Could not guess how the structure would be in the array as they were empty arrays.
